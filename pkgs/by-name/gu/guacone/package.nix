      Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition (GUAC) aggregates software
      security metadata into a high fidelity graph databaseâ€”normalizing entity
      identities and mapping standard relationships between them. Querying this
      graph can drive higher-level organizational outcomes such as audit,
      policy, risk management, and even developer assistance.
